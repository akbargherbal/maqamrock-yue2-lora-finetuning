# Progress

Durable, cross-session milestone record: what has actually been run, what it produced, and what's next. Append an entry when a run finishes or a phase changes; keep it short. Not a log — *why* things are the way they are lives in `DECISIONS.md`, and transient per-session detail lives in `agent_notes/current.md`.

## 2026-09-19 — Repo created, nothing trained yet

- Dataset built and independently verified: 267 audio/caption pairs, native `mp3, 48000 Hz, stereo`, no format mismatches against `ai-toolkit`'s YuE2 loader requirements. See `verification.md`.
- Config finalized (`config/akbar_arabic_rock_lora.yml`): rank 32, EMA on, `cot: off`, combined single LoRA across all four maqams, backup-aware (`max_step_saves_to_keep: 12`), Colab-ephemeral dataset path (`/content/yue2_dataset`).
- Observability plan settled: `loss_log.db` (via `monitor_loss.py`) as the primary metrics source, `-l` CLI log for tracebacks, `gpu_logger.py` for hardware stats — none of AI Toolkit's own logging surfaces cover GPU usage. See `DECISIONS.md`.
- Training-control policy set: agent may auto-resume an unchanged, already-approved run after a crash; anything new or changed needs the user to type the command.
- Bootstrap (`bootstrap/setup.sh`) written but **not yet run on a real VM** — next session should validate it end-to-end on a fresh Colab L4 before trusting the idempotent-skip logic.
- No training has been launched yet. Next: stand up a Colab L4, run `bootstrap/setup.sh`, confirm `loss_log.db` actually gets created and updates as expected, then launch the real run.
